Basic implementations of some common machine learning techniques

Genetic Programming
- Use gp to solve symbolic regression
- implements several mutation, crossover variation
- implements tournament selection, pareto front, lexicase selection

Neural Network
- implement back and forward propagation
- dynamic: as many layers and hidden nodes per layer as desired
- cross validation to determine network structure

k-nearest-neighbors
- very simple knn
- breaks ties dynamically
